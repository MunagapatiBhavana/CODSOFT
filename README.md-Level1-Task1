#CODSOFT

During my internship as a web developer at Codsoft, I created a personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project showcased my web development skills and provided a platform to display my work, achievements, and projects. The website is designed to be visually appealing and user-friendly, featuring sections for my resume, project portfolio, skills, and contact information.
Through this project, I gained valuable experience in front-end web development and design.
